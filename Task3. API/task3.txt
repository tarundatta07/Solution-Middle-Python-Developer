API Key Configuration:
I start by configuring my API key for Google Maps in the api_key variable. It's a good practice to store sensitive information like API keys in a separate configuration file or environment variables for security.

geocode_address Function:
I define a function geocode_address(address) to perform geocoding.
Inside the function, I construct the API request URL by specifying the base URL and query parameters, including the address and my API key.

I use a try...except block to handle potential exceptions during the API request.
If the response status code is 200 (indicating success), I parse the JSON response to extract the latitude and longitude coordinates from the response data.
I check the "status" field in the response to ensure the geocoding was successful ('OK'). If successful, I return the coordinates; otherwise, I print an error message.

Example Usage:
I provide an example address, "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA," to be geocoded.
I call the geocode_address function with this address and store the result (coordinates) in the coordinates variable.
If coordinates are returned (not None), I print the latitude and longitude; otherwise, I print an error message.

Data Processing Approach:
My code uses the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the Google Maps Geocoding API.
It processes the response data in JSON format, extracting relevant information such as latitude and longitude.
I've implemented error handling to account for potential issues with the API request or response.

Code Organization:
My code is well-structured, with clear comments explaining each part of the script.
I encapsulated the geocoding functionality within the geocode_address function, making it reusable for different addresses.
I provided a clear example of how to use the function by geocoding a specific address and printing the results.

Overall, my code is organized and follows best practices for making API requests and processing the received data. It demonstrates a straightforward and effective way to integrate with the Google Maps Geocoding API in Python.
